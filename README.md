Timestamper bot using discord.py and the API. Takes a time in your localtime in 24H time mm/dd/yy and converts it to a discord usable epoch timestamp in the format <t:xyz > which can be easily copypasted and a verification next to it. The only library I used was python's time. datetime actually makes it more complicated with timezones and naive and non-naive functionality. Has an algorithm that accounts for leap year and related to prevented odd errors. Just credit me if you use it. Feel free to messgae me with questions. MIT license.

Have fun!
